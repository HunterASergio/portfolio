                    With fast food restaurants around every corner, advertisements on television for 
                    calorie dense food, and social media displaying all the amazing food the world has 
                    to offer, it can be really difficult trying to make an effort to eat healthy. That 
                    is why we created D&A Juices. We want to offer our community a friendly environment 
                    where you can feel good about what you're eating. From our cold pressed juices to 
                    our acai bowls, our products are all tasty and healthy. We make sure that each day 
                    we walk into our facility, we have fresh fruits and vegetables available to use. If 
                    any of our products are not up to standard, we will not use or serve it as we very 
                    much value the quality of our products. As far as our goals for this company, we have 
                    a few that we want to reach our community:

                            - We want our customers to improve the way they think about health. This 
                            includes their body, nutrition, and mindset. Everyone wants to look and 
                            feel good, but it has to start from somewhere. You can workout as much 
                            as you want, but if you don't change the things that you put in your body, 
                            it will be very hard to acheive the goals you set for yourself. Even if 
                            you only come to our location once to get started in your journey to better 
                            health, we appreciate that you start with us.

                            - We want to be as transparent as possible. We can't be helpful to our 
                            community if we can't show or tell you exactly how we operate. This is why 
                            our location has an open and visible prep area so you can see exactly what 
                            we prepare each day, every order. We also encourage our customers to ask 
                            questions. We want you to be certain in what you're spending your hard 
                            earned money on.
