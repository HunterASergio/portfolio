                    We started off by buying a juicer and making our own cold pressed juices at home. 
                    At first, we were just sticking fruit in the juicer and drinking it as it was, but 
                    soon enough we found ourselves throwing different fruits in the juicer and seeing 
                    what we could create. The first mix we ever made was actually the Super Citrus and 
                    we fell in love with it. Once we got a good idea of what juices we actually wanted 
                    to make, we began letting our family members try them to see what they thought. They 
                    instantly fell in love and began pitching the idea of selling our juices locally. We 
                    spent a few weeks selling our products at our local market and it was a big hit, so 
                    after seeing great success, we decided to open our own juice bar. We spent time picking 
                    locations, making our menu, and on May 8th of 2023, we opened our first location. We 
                    have had great success helping others begin and continue their health improvement and 
                    we hope to continue this journey in the coming years!
