                    Danilo is a co-owner of D&A Juices. Leaving high school, he was unsure 
                    what he wanted to do as far as a career, but he always wanted to have his 
                    own business. Eventually he decided to go to school for business management. 
                    During that time in school, him and Alejandra were thinking of ideas to 
                    start a business. Well, somehow after making homemade cold pressed juices 
                    one night in their kitchen, they ended up creating D&A Juices together after 
                    hearing all the positive feedback they received from their close friends and 
                    family! Now, Danilo works hard each day with Alejandra to create delicious 
                    products for the community. Soon, he will begin to expand their business to reach a 
                    wider audience so that eveyone can experience D&A Juices!
