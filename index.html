                                - I have never had a bad experience here. The staff are always very friendly
                                and helpful when I can't decide on what delicious thing to try. I usually get
                                the medley green smoothie they offer but I recently have really been enjoy
                                the pineapple passion juice they have. The fresh ginger and lime they add to it really
                                is refreshing!

                                - I began coming here with my family soon after I became a dietician. Everything 
                                that they offer has done nothing but wonders for our family in terms of eating 
                                healthier. My two teenagers absolutely love the blueberry acai bowls they offer 
                                and I couldn't be happier! It's wonderful having a juice bar like this in our town.

                                - I didn't think anyone could make cold pressed juices better than me &#40;I am 
                                really bad at making juice&#41;, but boy was I wrong! The staff at D&A juices 
                                can really make some juice! I also know the owners Alejandra and Danilo personally 
                                so I 100&#x25; trust them to always make the best products!
